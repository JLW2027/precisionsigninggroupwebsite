TONE TIGHTENING (Estate planning / real estate traffic)
Use these optional micro-edits in your UI copy where appropriate:

- Replace “documents” with “estate, property, or business documents” in headings if your traffic is primarily those categories.
- Add a single trust-building line near the top of the FAQ page:
  “For time-sensitive real estate or estate planning signings, please book early to ensure availability.”
- In the “What to bring” answer, consider adding:
  “If your document requires witnesses, please confirm witness requirements with the document issuer in advance.”
- Keep the “no legal advice” disclosure visible and repeat it in the scheduling flow.
