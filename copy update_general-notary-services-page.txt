GENERAL NOTARY SERVICES SUB-PAGE SPEC (Cursor-ready)

GOAL
Create a General Notary Services sub-page with top-level buttons (tabs/segmented control) for each service. Clicking a button reveals the corresponding section copy below (tab-panel/accordion-style).

PAGE TITLE + INTRO COPY
H1: General Notary Services

Intro paragraph (customer-facing):
Notarial acts help deter fraud by verifying identity, willingness, and awareness at the time a document is signed. Below are the most common types of notarial services I provide, along with examples of when they’re typically needed in personal or business situations.

TOP-LEVEL BUTTONS (in this order)
1) Acknowledgments
2) Jurats (Oaths & Affirmations)
3) Signature Witnessing
4) Copy Certification
5) Oaths & Affirmations (Standalone)
6) Loan Signing Services
7) Business & Corporate Notarizations
8) Mobile & After-Hours Notary

DISCLOSURE FOOTER (always visible)
I am not an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Washington and cannot provide legal advice or assist in the preparation of legal documents.

CTA (bottom of page)
CTA heading: Not sure which service you need?
CTA text: If your document already specifies the notarial act required, I can help ensure it is completed correctly. If you are unsure, the document’s issuer or an attorney can advise which notarization is appropriate.
CTA button: Schedule a Notary Appointment

CONTENT FOR EACH BUTTON (Tab Panel Copy)

1) Acknowledgments
Panel heading: Acknowledgments
What it is: An acknowledgment confirms that the signer personally appeared before the notary, was properly identified, and acknowledged that they signed the document voluntarily.
Important note: The document may be signed before or in front of the notary — the signer is acknowledging the signature as their own.

Common examples:
- Deeds (quitclaim, warranty, special warranty)
- Powers of Attorney
- Business formation documents
- Trusts and estate planning documents
- Contracts and agreements

When you might need it:
- Transferring or refinancing property
- Granting authority to another person
- Executing formal legal or business agreements

2) Jurats (Oaths & Affirmations)
Panel heading: Jurats (Oaths & Affirmations)
What it is: A jurat requires the signer to sign the document in the notary’s presence and swear (or affirm) that the contents of the document are true.

Common examples:
- Affidavits
- Sworn statements
- Court-related documents
- Financial or insurance declarations

When you might need it:
- Submitting sworn information to a court or agency
- Providing a written statement under oath
- Completing official forms requiring a sworn declaration

3) Signature Witnessing
Panel heading: Signature Witnessing
What it is: The notary verifies the signer’s identity and witnesses the act of signing the document.

Common examples:
- Employment or HR forms
- Consent forms
- Private agreements
- Travel consent letters

When you might need it:
- When an organization requires proof that a signature was witnessed
- When parties want an added layer of verification for a private agreement

4) Copy Certification
Panel heading: Copy Certification
What it is: The notary certifies that a copy of a document is a true and accurate copy of the original, when permitted by Washington State law.

Common examples:
- Passports (copy only)
- Diplomas or transcripts
- Contracts or records
- Personal or business files

When you might need it:
- Submitting copies to schools, employers, or agencies
- Retaining certified copies for records
- Providing documentation without surrendering originals

Note (small text): Some documents (such as vital records) must be certified by the issuing authority, not a notary.

5) Oaths & Affirmations (Standalone)
Panel heading: Oaths & Affirmations (Standalone)
What it is: The notary administers a spoken oath or affirmation without notarizing a document.

Common examples:
- Depositions
- Verbal declarations
- Official proceedings

When you might need it:
- When an oath is required but no written document is involved
- In professional, regulatory, or formal settings

6) Loan Signing Services
Panel heading: Loan Signing Services
What it is: As a Notary Signing Agent, I facilitate the signing of loan documents by verifying identity, ensuring documents are signed correctly, and returning them securely to the hiring party.

Common examples:
- Mortgage refinances
- Home purchases and sales
- HELOCs
- Seller packages

When you might need it:
- Completing real estate or lending transactions
- After-hours or mobile signings
- When lenders or title companies require a trained signing agent

Compliance note (small text): I do not explain or interpret loan documents. Questions are directed to the lender, title company, or an attorney.

7) Business & Corporate Notarizations
Panel heading: Business & Corporate Notarizations
What it is: Notarization of documents used in business operations and corporate governance.

Common examples:
- Operating agreements
- Board resolutions
- Vendor contracts
- Intellectual property filings
- Construction or engineering documents

When you might need it:
- Forming or managing a business
- Executing high-value agreements
- Complying with regulatory or contractual requirements

8) Mobile & After-Hours Notary
Panel heading: Mobile & After-Hours Notary
What it is: I travel to your location for notarizations, including evenings and weekends by appointment.

Common examples:
- Homes
- Offices
- Hospitals or care facilities
- Job sites or meeting locations

When you might need it:
- Limited mobility or tight schedules
- Time-sensitive transactions
- Group or multi-signer events

CURSOR IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

UI behavior
- Render the 8 service buttons at top (desktop: horizontal wrap; mobile: scrollable row or 2-column grid).
- Default selected tab: Acknowledgments
- Clicking a button updates the selected tab and scrolls the panel into view (optional).

DATA-DRIVEN STRUCTURE
- Use a single TypeScript object/array (below) to render buttons + panels.
