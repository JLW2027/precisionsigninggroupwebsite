SEO PLAN UPDATE — Cursor Patch Notes (Precision Signing Group)

Goal: Update the existing “SEO Implementation Plan for Precision Signing Group (Updated)” with the following corrections and clarifications BEFORE implementation.

APPLY THESE CHANGES TO THE PLAN
===============================

1) Organization JSON-LD — Add logo (and optional sameAs)
- Update Phase 2.1 (Organization Schema) required fields to include:
  - logo: absolute URL to your logo (e.g., https://www.precisionsigninggroup.com/logo.png)
- Optional (only if you actually have these profiles):
  - sameAs: array of real profile URLs (Google Business Profile, Yelp, LinkedIn, etc.)
- Do NOT invent social links. Only include real URLs.

2) LocalBusiness JSON-LD — Be conservative with @type and address
- Keep LocalBusiness schema on ONE page only (homepage OR contact page).
- Keep @type as “LocalBusiness” unless you are certain a more specific type is supported in your validation tooling.
- Do NOT add a street address in JSON-LD unless:
  - it is published on the website AND
  - it matches Google Business Profile exactly.
- If you do not want a public street address, use:
  - addressLocality / addressRegion / addressCountry
  - areaServed and/or serviceArea
- Do NOT invent geo coordinates, hours, or priceRange unless you maintain them consistently.

3) FAQPage JSON-LD — Define a deterministic “ReactNode → plain text” rule
- Add a clear constraint to the plan:
  - JSON-LD answer text must be plain text (no JSX, HTML, or objects).
- Conversion rule (safe default):
  - If answers are strings, use them directly.
  - If answers are arrays/JSX, render to text by joining segments with spaces.
  - If there are bullet-like items, join with “; ” (or newline) consistently.
  - Strip links: keep visible text only.
- Add a test step:
  - Verify JSON-LD does not contain “[object Object]” and validates in Rich Results Test.

4) Services dynamic metadata — Prefer a server wrapper if the route is currently a client component
- If `app/services/[slug]/page.tsx` is a client component (“use client”), update plan to the safer pattern:
  - Create a server wrapper page that exports generateMetadata
  - Move interactive UI into a client component (e.g., ServiceClient.tsx)
- Reason: avoid client-only data access inside generateMetadata and reduce edge cases.

5) Sitemap lastModified — Accept short-term, but add a “later” note
- Keep lastModified using `new Date()` for now, but update plan to include:
  - “Later: replace with per-route timestamps (file mtime) or deploy/release timestamp to avoid every URL looking ‘recently modified’.”

6) Google Search Console verification — Keep the verification meta tag
- Update plan language to:
  - “Add the GSC verification meta tag in layout metadata and keep it (no need to remove later).”

OUTPUT REQUIREMENT FOR CURSOR
=============================
- Cursor should update the plan text itself (not implement code).
- Cursor should preserve the existing structure and constraints, applying only these additions/clarifications.
- Cursor should not add robots.txt/sitemap.xml static files.
- Smallest diff possible.

READY-TO-USE CURSOR PROMPT
==========================
Update the “SEO Implementation Plan for Precision Signing Group (Updated)” to incorporate the attached Patch Notes exactly.
Do not implement any code changes yet—only update the plan document.
Preserve the existing plan structure, constraints, and ordering; apply the smallest diff possible while adding the missing clarifications (logo/sameAs for Organization, conservative LocalBusiness address/type rules, deterministic FAQ plain-text conversion rules, safer server-wrapper guidance for services generateMetadata, sitemap lastModified follow-up note, and keeping GSC verification tag).
